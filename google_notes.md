## The ML-mindset

### Get Comfortable with Some Uncertainty
With ML, the non-coding work can be very complicated, but you'll usually write far less code.
Will you end-up with a usable model? You don't really know at the start

### Scientific Method
To address the challenges of transitioning to ML, it is helpful to think of the ML process as an experiment where we run test after test after test to converge on a workable model. Like an experiment, the process can be exciting, challenging, and ultimately worthwhile.

Step | Example
---- | ----
1. Set the research goal. |	I want to predict how heavy traffic will be on a given day.
2. Make a hypothesis. | I think the weather forecast is an informative signal
3. Collect the data. | Collect historical traffic data and weather on each day.
4. Test your hypothesis. | Train a model using this data.
5. Analyze your results. | Is this model better than existing systems?
6. Reach a conclusion. | I should (not) use this model to make predictions, because of X, Y, and Z.
7. Refine hypothesis and repeat. | Time of year could be a helpful signal
